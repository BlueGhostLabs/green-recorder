## About

A simple yet functional desktop recorder for Linux systems. Built using Python, GTK+ 3 and ffmpeg. It supports recording audio and video on almost all Linux interfaces. Also **supports Wayland display server on GNOME session**.

The following formats are currently supported: **mkv**, **avi**, **mp4**, **wmv** and **nut** (And only WebM for Wayland's GNOME session). You can stop the recording process easily by right-clicking the icon and choosing "Stop Record". Or middle-clicking the recording icon in the notifications area (but doesn't work on all interfaces).

Green recorder uses the default audio device you have to record. So if you want to change the audio input source, you just need to change it from the system-side (using **pavucontrol** for example).

By default, On Wayland only, Green Recorder uses the V8 encoder instead of the default V9 encoder in GNOME Shell because of the CPU & RAM consumption issue (#757172). Which should also give you better performance. On Xorg, each format uses its own default encoder.

This is a recording sample for DOTA 2 running on Wayland: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwCRBoOdJzU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwCRBoOdJzU)
