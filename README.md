# Green Recorder

## About

A simple yet functional desktop recorder for Linux systems. Built using Python, GTK+ 3 and ffmpeg. Currently it supports recording audio and video on almost all Linux interfaces. However, **Wayland support (GNOME session) is expected to be added soon**.

The following formats are currently available: **mkv**, **avi**, **mp4**, **wmv** and **nut**. You can stop the recording process easily by right-clicking the icon and choosing "Stop Record". Or middle-clicking the recording icon in the notifications area (but doesn't work on all interfaces).

This is a recording sample using this program: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxXetUgtvrw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxXetUgtvrw)

**REMEMBER:** This is the first public version. It's in its very early stages. Please be patient.

## TODO:

There's a big list of things to do right now. I might work on it if a lot of people need this program and its functionality:

* Add support for recording on Wayland (GNOME Shell Wayland Session, it offers a screencast tool, can be used).
* Add a checking method to see if ffmpeg already working properly or not before launching the tray.
* Add more possible formats supported by ffmpeg.
* Support more options like including the mouse pointer, recording a specific area and choosing input audio stream.
